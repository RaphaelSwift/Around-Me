##tl;dr

An Iphone application that search recent pictures and video posted by Instagram users around the user location. The images are displayed on a map and in a collection view.

##How to use

Requires an Instagram account to use.
Requires that the user allows the application to locate him.

Fetch new images automatically every 10 seconds. Refresh can also be done manually :
- On map view : By clicking on the refresh button
- In collection view: by pulling down the collection view

The maximum media items that can be displayed is set at 50. 

The search radius can be set from the map view.

Click on a thumbnail in the map or collection view to display a popover with a bigger image with details. By clicking on the popover, a webview is loaded with the Instagram webpage for this image, where the user can "like" , "post a comment" or "follow".
Clicking on the "Back" button will bring the user back to the map/collection view.

This application is most useful in a high density population area where new media are posted every few seconds as it will give a real time feeling of what's happening around the user.
